Market access is a critical aspect in pharma industry to ensure the products manufactured reaches the patients/customers on time and effectively.

Without proper accessment strategies, several pharma/biotech/life science often companies fail to enable timely access of their drugs/pharma products to the stakeholders. 
Therefore it is essential to have an effective market accessment frameworks and strategies that help these companies to make their products available to the community in the right time and continuously.

To design these strategies, the company needs to first have a robust understanding of who/how/when to execute their product launches to meet the goals. 

Firstly, they need to understand who are their stakeholders. Here, it is essential to knwo what are the lookouts of these stakeholders and does our product meet these needs in an affordable and contented manner. Timing monitoring these parameters is a great step rightly played.

Second, to know the key leads by which the product information can be rightly communicated to the stakeholders. Message calls, meetings, referrals, trainings, follow-ups, right product mix are some of the key strategies here. Latest means such as online telemarketing, digital infographic representations are some useful means of winning the competitive market

Next, planning of execution. For example: any drug that comes into the market has a life cycle and it is important for the company to understand in which stage (Pre-clinical, clinical trials, market ready) is it essential to work on the release plan. This includes the formulation of drug information, pricing, contract planning and also measure the right landscape (global or local). 

Rightly planned launch considerations by market assessment can effectively enhance the product sales in pharmaceutical companies.

Here is a small depiction of different metric calculation (xlsx file attahced) that is expected for market assessment of different drugs in top competitor companies. 
For this, I have created two types of tabular data:
1. One with information of drugs sold by competitors (sheet: Competitors_raw_data; Competitor_growth), the drug type, the market share for each drug and company for years 2021 and 2022 and the sales metric for 2022. 

Note that all of the numericals and data taken here is randomly generated and not real data (Using Rand and Randbetween Functions)

2. Second table depicts the sales information of the same drugs for our client company say XYZ (sheet: Sales_raw_data; Sales_KPI_Finds). Also some KPI were calculated from the base metrics (Revenue/close; Deals/lead)

Following are some of the insightful analytics done here:

a) From the first table, I could generate insights such as the total sales renevue generated by a particular company, drugs that made highest sales, the type of drugs sold etc (sheet: Data_insights). The analytics included important excel functions such as the PIVOT TABLES, Index function, Match function, SUMIFS,Conditional formatting, Indirect function etc

b) The Sales information from the competitors data has also been visualised using various excel dashboards (Sheet:Dashboards)

c) A dynamic performance scorecard was prepared comparing the sales metrics of company XYZ for the current quarter (Q4) and past quarter (Q1) by looking at the it drug wise and understanding the sales quality. The analytics included important functions such as the Name Manager, Sumifs, indirect and data validation (Sheet: sales_scorecard)

d) Another important insight (table and bar graph) was generated by combining data from the two different tables (similar to Joins in SQL but here done in excel) and looking at the sales metrics of company XYZ for the corresponding drugs in competitor companies. The important function used here is VLOOKUP and Sumifs) (Sheet: sales_insight)
